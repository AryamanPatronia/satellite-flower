Federated Learning Simulation Settings
Model Architecture
A custom lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) was used on all clients, designed for efficient learning on remote sensing data with limited compute resources. The architecture is as follows:

Input: RGB images, 64×64 pixels (EuroSAT dataset)
Layer 1: 2D Convolution (Conv2d), 3 input channels, 10 output channels, kernel size 5×5, followed by ReLU activation and 2×2 MaxPooling
(Input: (3, 64, 64) → Conv: (10, 60, 60) → Pool: (10, 30, 30))
Layer 2: 2D Convolution (Conv2d), 10 input channels, 20 output channels, kernel size 5×5, followed by ReLU activation and 2×2 MaxPooling
(Conv: (20, 26, 26) → Pool: (20, 13, 13))
Flatten: Output is flattened to a vector of size 20×13×13
Fully Connected 1: Linear layer with 50 output units, followed by ReLU activation
Fully Connected 2: Linear layer with 10 output units (one per class)
Output: Raw logits for 10 classes
Training Procedure
Optimizer: SGD with momentum
Learning rate: 0.01
Momentum: 0.9
Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss (no label smoothing)
Local Training Epochs: 3 per communication round
Batch Size: 32
Device: CUDA (GPU) if available, otherwise CPU
Data Partitioning
Dataset: EuroSAT (RGB, 64×64)
Partitioning: The dataset was partitioned into five non-overlapping client datasets, each simulating a satellite. Each client’s data is stored in data/clients_data/client_{client_id}/.
Label Distribution: Each client receives a unique subset of four classes (out of ten), simulating a highly non-iid scenario:
Client 1: labels [0, 1, 2, 3]
Client 2: labels [2, 3, 4, 5]
Client 3: labels [4, 5, 6, 7]
Client 4: labels [6, 7, 8, 9]
Client 5: labels [0, 1, 8, 9]
Sample Counts: Client datasets range from 1,497 to 1,737 training samples each.
Pixel Value Range: All images are normalized; pixel values range from approximately -2.6 to 4.4.
Train/Test Split: Each client’s data is pre-split into training and test sets, saved as PyTorch tensors.
Central Test Set
Composition: The central test set contains 1,600 samples, evenly covering all 10 EuroSAT classes ([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]).
Shape: x shape: [1600, 3, 64, 64], y shape: [1600]
Pixel Value Range: min ≈ -2.27, max ≈ 4.39
Purpose: Used for global evaluation after each communication round to assess overall model generalization.
Evaluation
Client Metric: Top-1 accuracy on each client’s local test set after local training.
Central Metric: Top-1 accuracy on the central test set after each round, reported and plotted as a function of simulated time.
Federated Learning Protocol
Framework: Flower (flwr)
Strategy: FedAvg & FedAsync
Client Participation: Each round, only clients visible according to the satellite-ground visibility schedule participate in training.
Rounds: 30 communication rounds (each representing 4 hours of simulated time).
Server Aggregation: Model weights are averaged across participating clients each round.
Additional Details
Ground Station: Simulated as a parameter server, located at latitude 55.0°, longitude 0.0°.
Simulation Environment: All code executed in a controlled environment with deterministic data splits and fixed random seeds for reproducibility.
Logging: Training loss and accuracy are logged for each client and round; global accuracy is plotted as a function of simulated time.
